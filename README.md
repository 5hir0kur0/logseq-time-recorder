# Logseq Time Recorder

This is a simple plugin for tracking working hours.
Logseq has a built-in feature to track the time spent `DOING` a `TODO` block. However, it is not possible to edit this information (e.g., if you forgot to change the state from `TODO` to `DOING` when you started working on a task) from _within_ Logseq.

## Demo

## Features

- Track your working hours during a workday.
- Track working hours across multiple days using the `long` date format.
- Button to clock in and clock out.
- The recorded times are also manually editable.
- Specify a goal duration (currently not exposed in the UI, but you can manually add it as the first argument, e.g. `{{renderer :time-recorder, goal: 8h, 09:00}}`)

## Future Goals

- Ideally I would like this to integrate with the built-in `:LOGBOOK:` syntax that is used for `TODO` blocks, but I don't know how to this with a plugin. It would be even better if Logseq just provided some UI for editing the `:LOGBOOK:`, then this plugin would be obsolete.
- Maybe make it work across days (currently it only records HH:MM timestamps).

I am not a web developer. If you know how to make the code nicer or the UI prettier, please submit a PR :-)

## Building and Running the Plugin

- `npm install && npm run build` in terminal to install dependencies.
- `Load unpacked plugin` in Logseq Desktop client.
